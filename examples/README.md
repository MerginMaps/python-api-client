# Jupyter Notebooks examples gallery

Here you can find some tailored Jupyter Notebooks examples on how to interact with Mergin Maps Python API client.

These examples are split into scenarios in order to highlight some of the core capabilities of the Mergin Maps API.

## [Scenario 1](01_users.ipynb) - Users Management
On this scenario you'll create some random users from an existing CSV into Mergin Maps, change user's `ROLE` on a `WORKSPACE` and `PROJECT` perspective as well remove user's from a specific project.

## [Scenario 2](02_sync.ipynb) - Synchronization
On this scenario you'll learn on how to do basic synchronisation (`PUSH`, `PULL`) of projects with the Mergin Maps Python API client.

## [Scenario 3](03_projects.ipynb) - Projects Management
On this scenario you'll learn how to manage project with the Mergin Maps Python API client, namely how to clone projects and how to separate team members in isolated projects from the cloned template.
